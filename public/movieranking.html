<h3>Silicon Valley</h3>
<p>It's a great watch for any aspiring computer science engineer on how silicon 
valley is and it is even hella comedic.</p>
<h3>The Social Network</h3>
<p>One of the if not the greatest tech movies ever build.</p>
<h3>Honor Society</h3>
<p>One of the underrated once, definately recommended.</p>
