<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Aspiring Software Engineer and a current student at MIT World Peace University, where I am building a strong foundation in computer science principles. My coursework in Data Structures, Object-Oriented Programming, and C has provided me with hands-on experience in algorithmic problem-solving, software design, and system-level programming.</p>

<p>I believe that strong technical skills are most effective when paired with collaboration and clear communication. My experiences competing in academic Olympiads, debates, and team sports have been instrumental in developing my skills in teamwork, leadership, and strategic thinking. I am eager to apply this blend of technical and interpersonal skills to real-world challenges and am actively seeking internship opportunities in software development. Please feel free to connect!</p>
